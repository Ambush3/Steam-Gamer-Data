Using Valva Player Data.csv from Kaggle, I was able to plot out data to show what games in 2021, had the most peak amount of players, the highest percentage gain, the average amount of players at one time, and what popular games have slowly declined in growth. 

I used pandas, pyplot, seaborn, numpy, and ipywidgets.
